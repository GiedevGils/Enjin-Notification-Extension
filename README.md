# Enjin Notifications
### Let your Enjin browser notifications appear on your desktop

This [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) extension allows you to have Chrome extensions pop up on your desktop. You can click on said pop up to go to the page of the notification.

The black bar you can see on both images is the URL of the source of the notification.

## Disclaimer
*This extension is still in development. There will be bugs and/or missing features.*

Some known issues:

- Multiple open Enjin tabs logged in on the same account will mean that you will get multiple pop-ups on the same notification.
- Notifications will not appear if you are playing something on fullscreen. 

## Credits
I do want to credit [Enjin user ROJO](https://www.enjin.com/profile/rojo8399) for making [this post](https://www.enjin.com/forums/m/10826/viewthread/27087168-free-code-chrome-notifications/post/117997305#p117997305) back in May 2016. He gave me the base for this code, and I only altered it a little bit to transform it into a Chrome extension.
